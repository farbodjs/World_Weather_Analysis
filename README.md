# World_Weather_Analysis
Weather Analysis for Random Geographical coordinates and building of a travel app for customers of 700+ cities around the world.
# Project Overview
In this project, a travel app for users is developed using OpenWeatherMap APIs of 600+ cities along with the data gather from GoogleMaps APS to recommend ideal hotels based on clientsâ€™ weather preferences.
# Tools
Python, citipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, Google Maps API, Google Places API, OpenWeatherMap API, Jupyter Notebook
#Summary
## Vacation_Search: The Travel App allows users to search for locations they want to travel based on their temperature preferences. They are given the chance to set their minimum and maximum temperature, and based on this selection, our algorythm gives them a list of random locations based on OpenWeatherMap API and GoogleMap APIs, a heatmap will be showed to them for the maximum temperature for the filtered cities around the world.
